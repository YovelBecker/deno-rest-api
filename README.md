# A Deno REST API Starter

A starter project for a basic Deno rest api.

The project folder has an example for an entity by using a Product entity.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```git
git clone https://github.com/YovelBecker/deno-rest-api.git
```

## Usage

Next step for this project will be to change the file names accordingly and starting to use this project as a normal REST api like using a DB instead of a static array and more.
